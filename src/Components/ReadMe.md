## Introduction
- This is a fully functioning calculator that was built using React. I learned how to manage different peices of state in this project a little bit better building this in hooks. We had trouble figuring out a few things but came together at the end as a group and completed this project which is just very cool to me. I love teamwork!

## Instructions
- Click the buttons to calculate!! It will let you know if there is a function it cannot compute (and it's cute). A very useful tool!
